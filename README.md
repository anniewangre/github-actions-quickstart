Part I Step 4: 
In step 1, when the direction says "create a .github/workflows directory," it's helpful to instead make it more clear that it should be a folder and include screenshots of what the directory should look like after it is created. In step 4, it's helpful to include more specific screenshots for things such as the pull request as well. It's also helpful to make sure that the screenshots are up-to-date since the actual current page looks a bit different from the screenshot included. The rest of the directions and screenshots are relatively clear and easy to follow.
